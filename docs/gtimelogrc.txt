NAME
       gtimelogrc - gtimelog configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       This  is  the  configuration  file  for  gtimelog(1).   It  is a pretty
       standard INI file as recognized by Python's ConfigParser, which means:

       · it consists of sections, led by a [name] header

       · values are specified as name = value (or name: value)

       · values can be continued across multiple lines if  continuation  lines
         start with whitespace

       · comments are lines starting with # or ;

       · if  the  same  value appears multiple times, new appearances override
         old ones

       Only one section is important to gtimelog: [gtimelog].  Within  it  you
       can specify the following settings:

       list-email
              recipient address for activity reports

              Example: name = activity-reports@example.com

       name   your name as it should appear in the reports

              Example: name = Marius

       mailer command to launch your email client.

              If  %s  appears  in  the  command,  it  will  be replaced by the
              filename of the draft of the email.  If %s  doesn't  appear,  it
              will be added to the end of the command.

              Example:  mailer  =  gedit  will  just open the report in GEdit,
              useful if you don't want to send it to anyone.

              Example: mailer = x-terminal-emulator -e mutt -H  %s  (which  is
              the  default  setting)  will  open  Mutt  with  the  draft  in a
              terminal.  x-terminal-emulator is a Debianism.

              Example:  mailer  =  S='%s';  thunderbird  -compose   "to='$(cat
              $S|head  -1|sed  -e "s/^To: //")',subject='$(cat $S|head -2|tail
              -1|sed -e "s/^Subject: //")',body='$(cat $S|tail -n  +4)'"  will
              open Thunderbird with the draft.

       editor text editor to be used for editing timelog.txt

              If  %s  appears  in  the  command,  it  will  be replaced by the
              filename of the timelog.txt file.  If %s doesn't appear, it will
              be added to the end of the command.

              Example:  editor  = xdg-open (the default value) opens whichever
              program is associated with .txt files on your system.

       spreasheet
              program used to display CSV reports

              If %s appears in  the  command,  it  will  be  replaced  by  the
              filename  of  the  CSV report.  If %s doesn't appear, it will be
              added to the end of the command.

              Example:  spreadsheet  =  xdg-open  (the  default  value)  opens
              whichever program is associated with .csv files on your system.

       chronological, summary_view
              select the initial detail level

              GTimeLog can show you one of three detail levels:

              · chronological (Alt+1) shows all the entries in order

              · grouped (Alt+2) shows only work entries, grouped by title

              · summary (Alt+3) shows only categories of work entries, grouped

              Example:

                 # start in chronological view
                 chronological = True
                 summary_view = False

              Example

                 # start in grouped view
                 chronological = False
                 summary_view = False

              Example

                 # start in summary view
                 summary_view = True

       show_tasks
              should the task pane be shown on startup?

              Example: show_tasks = True

       enable_gtk_completion
              should the input box show an autocompletion popup?

              If  set  to  True,  the Up and Down keys navigate the completion
              popup menu.

              If set to False, the Up and Down keys trigger  prefix-completion
              in the input box.

              Note    that   PageUp   and   PageDown   keys   always   trigger
              prefix-completion, so there's no good  reason  to  ever  disable
              this option.

              Example: enable_gtk_completion = True

       hours  goal for the number of hours of work in a day

              This is used to display the "Time left at work" estimate.

              Example: hours = 4

       virtual_midnight
              hour  in the morning when it's safe to assume you're not staying
              up working any more.

              Any work done between midnight and "virtual  midnight"  will  be
              attributed to the previous calendar day.

              Example: virtual_midnight = 2:00 (the default setting)

              Warning:  changing this setting may mean that old reports can no
              longer be correctly reconstructed from timelog.txt

       task_list_url
              URL for downloading the task list

              If not set, tasks will be read from a local file  (tasks.txt  in
              the gtimelog data directory)

              If  set,  tasks  will be loaded from the specified URL (but only
              when  you  right-click  and  explicitly  ask  for  a   refresh).
              GTimeLog expects a text/plain response with a list of tasks, one
              per line.  At the time of this  writing  GTimeLog  doesn't  show
              HTTP  authentication  prompts,  so if you need auth, you need to
              put your username and password into the URL.

              This feature is mostly useless.

              Example: task_list_url = (the default setting)

              Example:                     task_list_url                     =
              https://wiki.example.com/Project/Tasks/raw

       edit_tasklist_cmd
              command for editing the task list

              Example:  edit_tasklist_cmd  = (the default setting)  means that
              the "Edit task list" command in the popup menu will be disabled.

              Example:          edit_tasklist_cmd          =          xdg-open
              ~/.local/share/gtimelog/tasks.txt

              Example:          edit_tasklist_cmd          =          xdg-open
              https://wiki.example.com/Project/Tasks/edit

              Bug: this command should support  %s  for  specifying  the  full
              tasks.txt pathname, but it doesn't.

       show_office_hours
              whether  to  show "At office today: NN hours, NN minutes" in the
              main window

              Example: show_office_hours = True

       show_tray_icon
              whether to show a notification icon

              Example: show_tray_icon = True

       prefer_app_indicator, prefer_old_tray_icon
              what kind of tray icon do you prefer?

              GTimeLog supports three kinds:

              · Unity application indicator

              · a standard Gtk+ status icon

              · ancient EggTrayIcon that shows a ticking  clock  next  to  the
                icon

              Support for each is conditional on the availability of installed
              libraries.

              Example:

                 # prefer Unity application indicators, then fall back to the Gtk+
                 # status icon, then fall back to EggTrayIcon.
                 prefer_app_indicator = True

              Example:

                 # prefer the ancient EggTrayIcon, then fall back to the Gtk+
                 # status icon, then fall back to Unity app indicator.
                 prefer_app_indicator = False
                 prefer_old_tray_icon = True

              Example:

                 # prefer the Gtk+ status icon, then fall back to the ancient
                 # EggTrayIcon, then fall back to Unity app indicator.
                 prefer_app_indicator = False
                 prefer_old_tray_icon = False

       start_in_tray
              whether GTimeLog should start minimized

              This can also be achieved by running  gtimelog  --tray,  so  the
              option is of little use.

              This  option  is  ignored  if  GTimeLog is not using a tray icon
              (because show_tray_icon is set to False, or  if  you're  missing
              all the libraries).

              Example:: start_in_tray = False

       report_style
              choose one of the available report styles for weekly and monthly
              reports

              Example:: report_style = plain (the default)

              The report looks like this:

                 cat1: entry1                              N h N min
                 cat1: entry2                              N h N min
                 cat2: entry1                              N h N min

                 Total work done this week: N hours N min

                 By category:

                 cat1: N hours N min
                 cat2: N hours N min

              Example:: report_style = categorized

              The report looks like this:

                 category 1:
                   entry1                                      MM
                   entry2                                   HH:MM
                 ------------------------------------------------
                                                            HH:MM
                 category 2:
                   entry1                                      MM
                   entry2                                   HH:MM
                 ------------------------------------------------
                                                            HH:MM

                 Total work done this week: HH:MM

                 Categories by time spent:

                 category 1       HH:MM
                 category 2       HH:MM

EXAMPLE
       Example of ~/.config/gtimelog/gtimelogrc:

          [gtimelog]

          # Be sure to change these if you want to email the reports somewhere
          name = Anonymous
          list-email = activity@example.com

          # Don't want email?  Just look at reports in a text editor
          mailer = gedit %s

          # Set a goal for 7 hours and 30 minutes of work per day
          hours = 7.5

          # I'll never stay up working this late
          virtual_midnight = 06:00

          # Disable the tray icon
          show_tray_icon = no

          # Hide the Tasks pane on startup
          show_tasks = no

BUGS
       The config file should not be necessary.  GTimeLog  should  figure  out
       the  right  programs  by looking at your desktop preferences; it should
       remember the view options from a previous  invocation;  and  it  should
       have  a  GUI  way for specifying things such as your name or the report
       mailing list.

FILES
       ~/.gtimelog/gtimelogrc
       ~/.config/gtimelog/gtimelogrc

          Configuration file.

          GTimeLog determines the location for the config file as follows:

          1. If  the  environment   variable   GTIMELOG_HOME   is   set,   use
             $GTIMELOG_HOME/gtimelogrc.

          2. If ~/.gtimelog/ exists, use ~/.gtimelog/gtimelogrc.

          3. If   the   environment   variable  XDG_CONFIG_HOME  is  set,  use
             $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtimelog/gtimelogrc.

          4. Use ~/.config/gtimelog/gtimelogrc.
