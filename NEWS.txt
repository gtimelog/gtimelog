Changes in version 0.5.0 (released 2011-01-28)
==============================================

* Switched from Glade to GtkBuilder.  This fixes those strange theme problems
  GTimeLog had with Ubuntu's Radiance and especially Ambiance. (LP: #644393)

  Packagers note: src/gtimelog/gtimelog.glade is gone, it was replaced by
  src/gtimelog/gtimelog.ui.  It needs to be installed into
  /usr/share/gtimelog/.

* GTimeLog now supports Ubuntu's application indicators.  There's a new
  configuration option, ``prefer_app_indicator``, defaulting to true.
  Fixes LP: #523461.

* GTimeLog tries to detect your theme color and make the tray icon dark or
  bright, for good contrast.  This is a hack that doesn't work reliably, but
  is better than nothing.  Fixes LP: #700428.

  Packagers note: there's a new icon file,
  src/gtimelog/gtimelog-small-bright.png.  It needs to be installed into
  /usr/share/gtimelog/.

* Made GTimeLog a single instance application.  Requires python-dbus.
  The following command line options are supported::

    gtimelog --ignore-dbus
        always launch a new application instance, do not start the DBus service

    gtimelog --toggle
        if GtimeLog already running, show or hide the GTimeLog window,
        otherwise launch a new application instance

    gtimelog
        if GtimeLog already running, bring the GTimeLog window to the front,
        otherwise launch a new application instance

  Contributed by Bruce van der Kooij (https://launchpad.net/~brucevdk),
  Fixes LP: #356495.

* New option: start_in_tray.  Defaults to false.  Contributed by Bruce van der
  Kooij (https://launchpad.net/~brucevdk), as part of his patch for LP:
  #356495.

* New command-line option: --tray.  Makes GTimeLog start minimized, or exit
  without doing anything if it's already running.

* Added some documentation for contributors: HACKING.txt.

* Daily reports include totals by category.  Contributed by Laurynas Speičys
  <laurynas@pov.lt>.

* The tasks pane can be toggled by pressing F9 and has a close button.

* Alternative weekly and monthly report style, can be chosen by adding
  ``report_style = categorized`` to ~/.gtimelog/gtimelogrc.
  Contributed by Laurynas Speičys <laurynas@pov.lt>.

* Bugfix: always preserve the order of entries, even when they have the same
  timestamp (LP: #708825).


Changes in version 0.4.0 (released 2010-09-03)
==============================================

* Added configuration variable 'chronological' to control initial view of
  either Chronological (True) or Grouped (False).  Contributed by Barry Warsaw
  <barry@python.org> (LP: #628876)

* Recognize $GTIMELOG_HOME environment variable to use something other than
  ~/.gtimelog as the configuration directory.  Contributed by Barry Warsaw
  <barry@python.org> (LP: #628873)

* Changed application name to 'GTimeLog Time Tracker' in the desktop file
  (Debian #595280)


Changes in version 0.3.2 (released 2010-07-22)
==============================================

* Double-clicking a category in task list tries hard to focus the input box
  (fixes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/608734).

* Change default mailer to quote the command passed to x-terminal-emulator -e;
  this makes it work with Terminator (also tested with xterm and
  gnome-terminal).  Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/592552.

  Note: if you've used gtimelog before, you'll have to manually edit
  ~/.gtimelog/gtimelogrc and change the mailer line from

    mailer = x-terminal-emulator -e mutt -H %s

  to

    mailer = x-terminal-emulator -e "mutt -H %s"

* Use xdg-open by default for editing timelog.txt and opening spreadsheets.
  Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/592560.

  Note: if you've used gtimelog before, you'll have to manually edit
  ~/.gtimelog/gtimelogrc and change

    editor = gvim
    spreadhsheet = oocalc %s

  to

    editor = xdg-open
    spreadsheet = xdg-open %s


Changes in version 0.3.1 (released 2009-12-18)
==============================================

* Fixed broken sdist (by adding MANIFEST.in, since setuptools doesn't
  understand bzr by default).
* Added Makefile for convenience (make distcheck, make release).


Changes in version 0.3 (released 2009-12-17)
============================================

* Fix DeprecationWarning: the sets module is deprecated.
* Use gtk.StatusIcon if egg.trayicon is not available
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/209798).
* Option to select between old-style and new-style the tray icons:
  'prefer_old_tray_icon' in ~/.gtimelog/gtimelogrc
* Option to disable the tray icon altogether by adding 'show_tray_icon = no' to
  ~/.gtimelog/gtimelogrc (https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/255618).
* Handle directory names with spaces
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/328118).
* Show version number in the About dialog
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/308750).

Packagers take note: the main module was renamed from gtimelog.gtimelog to
gtimelog.main.  If you have wrapper scripts that used to import 'main'
from gtimelog.gtimelog, you'll have to change them.


Changes in version 0.2.5
========================

* Don't open a console window on Windows.

* Moved the primary GTimeLog source repository to Bazaar hosted on Launchpad.


Changes in version 0.2.4
========================

* Show time spent at the office
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/238515).
* Closing the main window minimizes GTimeLog to the system tray
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/239271)
* Ability to time-offset new log item
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/291356)


Changes in version 0.2.3
========================

* Fix duplicates in the completion popup after you reload the log file
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/238505).
* Change status to Beta in setup.py -- while I still consider it to be
  less polished than it should, there are people who find it useful already.


Changes in version 0.2.2
========================

* Tweak setup.py to get a sane page at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gtimelog/


Changes in version 0.2.1
========================

* Entries with `***` are skipped from reports (bug 209750)
* Help -> Online Documentation opens a browser with some help (bug 209754)
* View -> Tasks allows you to hide the Tasks pane (bug 220773)


Changes in version 0.2.0
========================

* Reorganize the source tree properly.
* Bump intermediate revision number to celebrate.


Changes in version 0.0.85
=========================

* First setuptools-based release (`easy_install gtimelog` now works).


Changes in older versions
=========================
