0.7.1 (2012-02-01)
==================
* Fix reporting problems with non-ASCII characters when using
  gobject-introspection (LP: #785578).
* Fix ^C not exiting the app when using gobject-introspection.
* Implement panel icon color autodetection logic that was missing in the
  gobject-introspection case (LP: #924390).
* New command-line option: --help.
* New command-line option: --replace.  Requires that the running version
  support the new DBus method 'Quit', which was also added in this version.
* Messages printed to stdout are prefixed by "gtimelog" (GUI app output often
  ends up in ~/.xsession-errors, it's polite to identify yourself when writing
  there).
* DBus errors do not pass silently.


0.7.0 (2011-09-21)
==================
* Use gobject-introspection by default, using pygtk only as a fallback.  This
  will require a newer gir1.2-pango-1.0 than what's in Ubuntu Oneiric
  (LP: #855076) and still suffers from key presses being ignored
  (LP: #849732).  Unset the environment variable UBUNTU_MENUPROXY to work
  around the latter bug.
* Rework the gi/pygtk imports so that only the minimum is wrapped in a
  try-except.
* Use /usr/bin/env python in #! line, though this should be hard-coded to the
  installed version of Python in the Debian package.
* Other code cleanup (e.g. use new-style classes via __metaclass__, remove
  ancient workaround for missing `set` built-in).


0.6.1 (2011-09-20)
==================
* Fix two crashes when using GI.  Given by Martin Pitt.


0.6.0 (2011-08-23)
==================
* Ctrl-Q now quits.  (LP: #750092)
* Fixed UnboundLocalError.  (LP: #778285)  Given by Jeroen Langeveld.
* Ported from PyGTK to GI. This supports GTK 2 and GTK 3 with GI now, but still
  works with PyGTK.
  Contributed by Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>.

  Packager's note: If you want to use GI, you need to change the package's
  dependencies from pygtk to the package that provides the GTK and Pango
  typelibs (e. g. gir1.2-gtk-2.0 and gir1.2-pango-1.0 on Debian/Ubuntu). It
  also requires pygobject >= 2.27.1.

* Hide the main window on Esc.  Fixes LP: #716257.
  Contributed by Vladislav Naumov (https://launchpad.net/~vnaum).


0.5.0 (2011-01-28)
==================
* Switched from Glade to GtkBuilder.  This fixes those strange theme problems
  GTimeLog had with Ubuntu's Radiance and especially Ambiance. (LP: #644393)

  Packagers note: src/gtimelog/gtimelog.glade is gone, it was replaced by
  src/gtimelog/gtimelog.ui.  It needs to be installed into
  /usr/share/gtimelog/.

* GTimeLog now supports Ubuntu's application indicators.  There's a new
  configuration option, ``prefer_app_indicator``, defaulting to true.
  Fixes LP: #523461.
* GTimeLog tries to detect your theme color and make the tray icon dark or
  bright, for good contrast.  This is a hack that doesn't work reliably, but
  is better than nothing.  Fixes LP: #700428.

  Packagers note: there's a new icon file,
  src/gtimelog/gtimelog-small-bright.png.  It needs to be installed into
  /usr/share/gtimelog/.

* Made GTimeLog a single instance application.  Requires python-dbus.
  The following command line options are supported::

    gtimelog --ignore-dbus
        Always launch a new application instance, do not start the DBus
        service.

    gtimelog --toggle
        If GtimeLog already running, show or hide the GTimeLog window,
        otherwise launch a new application instance.

    gtimelog
        If GtimeLog already running, bring the GTimeLog window to the front,
        otherwise launch a new application instance.

  Contributed by Bruce van der Kooij (https://launchpad.net/~brucevdk),
  Fixes LP: #356495.

* New option: start_in_tray.  Defaults to false.  Contributed by Bruce van der
  Kooij (https://launchpad.net/~brucevdk), as part of his patch for LP:
  #356495.
* New command-line option: --tray.  Makes GTimeLog start minimized, or exit
  without doing anything if it's already running.
* Added some documentation for contributors: HACKING.txt.
* Daily reports include totals by category.  Contributed by Laurynas Speičys
  <laurynas@pov.lt>.
* The tasks pane can be toggled by pressing F9 and has a close button.
* Alternative weekly and monthly report style, can be chosen by adding
  ``report_style = categorized`` to ~/.gtimelog/gtimelogrc.
  Contributed by Laurynas Speičys <laurynas@pov.lt>.
* Bugfix: always preserve the order of entries, even when they have the same
  timestamp (LP: #708825).


0.4.0 (2010-09-03)
==================
* Added configuration variable 'chronological' to control initial view of
  either Chronological (True) or Grouped (False).  Contributed by Barry Warsaw
  <barry@python.org> (LP: #628876)
* Recognize $GTIMELOG_HOME environment variable to use something other than
  ~/.gtimelog as the configuration directory.  Contributed by Barry Warsaw
  <barry@python.org> (LP: #628873)
* Changed application name to 'GTimeLog Time Tracker' in the desktop file
  (Debian #595280)


0.3.2 (2010-07-22)
==================
* Double-clicking a category in task list tries hard to focus the input box
  (fixes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/608734).
* Change default mailer to quote the command passed to x-terminal-emulator -e;
  this makes it work with Terminator (also tested with xterm and
  gnome-terminal).  Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/592552.

  Note: if you've used gtimelog before, you'll have to manually edit
  ~/.gtimelog/gtimelogrc and change the mailer line from

    mailer = x-terminal-emulator -e mutt -H %s

  to

    mailer = x-terminal-emulator -e "mutt -H %s"

* Use xdg-open by default for editing timelog.txt and opening spreadsheets.
  Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/592560.

  Note: if you've used gtimelog before, you'll have to manually edit
  ~/.gtimelog/gtimelogrc and change

    editor = gvim
    spreadhsheet = oocalc %s

  to

    editor = xdg-open
    spreadsheet = xdg-open %s


0.3.1 (2009-12-18)
==================
* Fixed broken sdist (by adding MANIFEST.in, since setuptools doesn't
  understand bzr by default).
* Added Makefile for convenience (make distcheck, make release).


0.3 (2009-12-17)
================
* Fix DeprecationWarning: the sets module is deprecated.
* Use gtk.StatusIcon if egg.trayicon is not available
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/209798).
* Option to select between old-style and new-style the tray icons:
  'prefer_old_tray_icon' in ~/.gtimelog/gtimelogrc
* Option to disable the tray icon altogether by adding 'show_tray_icon = no' to
  ~/.gtimelog/gtimelogrc (https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/255618).
* Handle directory names with spaces
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/328118).
* Show version number in the About dialog
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/308750).

Packagers take note: the main module was renamed from gtimelog.gtimelog to
gtimelog.main.  If you have wrapper scripts that used to import 'main'
from gtimelog.gtimelog, you'll have to change them.


0.2.5
=====
* Don't open a console window on Windows.
* Moved the primary GTimeLog source repository to Bazaar hosted on Launchpad.


0.2.4
=====
* Show time spent at the office
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/238515).

* Ability to time-offset new log item
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/291356)


0.2.3
=====
* Fix duplicates in the completion popup after you reload the log file
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/238505).
* Change status to Beta in setup.py -- while I still consider it to be
  less polished than it should, there are people who find it useful already.


0.2.2
=====
* Tweak setup.py to get a sane page at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gtimelog/


0.2.1
=====
* Entries with `***` are skipped from reports (bug 209750)
