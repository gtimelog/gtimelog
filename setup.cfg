# https://pep8.readthedocs.org/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes
# These are ignored by default:
# - E121: continuation line under-indented for hanging indent
# - E123: closing bracket does not match indentation of opening bracket's line
# - E126: continuation line over-indented for hanging indent
# - E133: closing bracket does not match visual indentation
# - E226: missing whitespace around arithmetic operator
# - E241: multiple spaces after ','
# - E242: tab after ','
# - E704: multiple statements on one line (def)
# These were added because PEP-8 allows exceptions, but pep8 doesn't:
# - E501: line too long
# - E301: expected 1 blank line, found 0
# - E261: at least two spaces before inline comment
# - E127: continuation line over-indented for visual indent
# - E128: continuation line under-indented for visual indent
# - W391: blank line at end of file
# These were added because PEP-8 is wrong sometimes
# - W503: line break before binary operator
# These were added because I need to break a rule for reasons
# - E402: module level import not at top of file
