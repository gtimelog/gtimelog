        Installing
        ----------
        
        GTimeLog is packaged for Debian and Ubuntu::
        
          sudo apt-get install gtimelog
        
        For Ubuntu, a newer version can usually be found in the PPA:
        
          https://launchpad.net/~gtimelog-dev/+archive/ppa
        
        You can fetch the latest released version from PyPI ::
        
          $ pip install gtimelog
          $ gtimelog
        
        You can run it from a source checkout without an explicit installation step::
        
          $ git clone https://github.com/gtimelog/gtimelog
          $ cd gtimelog
          $ make
          $ ./gtimelog
        
        System requirements:
        
        - Python (2.7 or 3.3+)
        - PyGObject
        - gobject-introspection type libraries for GTK+, Pango
        - GTK+ 3.10 or newer (3.14 or newer for best results)
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        This is work in progress:
        
        - `docs/index.rst`_ contains an overview
        - `docs/formats.rst`_ describes the file formats

        GTimeLog was mainly written by Marius Gedminas <marius@gedmin.as>.
        
        Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org> stepped in as a co-maintainer when
        Marius burned out.  Then Barry got busy and Marius recovered.

        Changelog
        ---------
        
        0.11.2 (2018-11-03)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Window menu now includes items previously shown only in the app menu:
          Preferences, About (GH: #126).
        
        - Keyboard shortcuts window (press Ctrl+Shift+?).
        
        - Dropped the help page (there was only one and it was only listing keyboard
          shortucts, and it was also incomplete and had no translations).
        
        - Bugfix: if timelog.txt was a symlink, changes to the symlink target would
          not get noticed automatically (GH: #128).
        
        
        0.11.1 (2018-07-18)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * The undocmented remote task list over HTTP(S) feature is now able to ask
          for basic HTTP authentication credentials and store them in gnome-keyring
          (GH: #109).
        
        * Bugfix: entries with just a category and no task that did not have
          a trailing space after the ':' were considered to be uncategorized
          (GH: #117).
        
        * Add Python 3.7 support.
        
        * Drop Python 3.3 support.
        
        
        0.11 (2017-12-16)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * A complete rewrite of the user interface, to better fit GNOME 3 (GH: #31).
          Requires GTK+ 3.10, but newer versions are better.
        
        * History browsing can show you weeks/months, not just days.
        
        * You can filter the displayed tasks, with a total shown at the bottom
          (GH: #88).
        
        * There's now a preferences dialog (GH: #47).
        
        * Window size and task pane size/visibility are remembered across
          restarts (GH: #30).
        
        * Settings are stored in GSettings.  The old config file will be imported
          on first startup.
        
        * Work hours and office hours are separate settings now (GH: #46).
        
        * Native support for emailing reports.  Requires a configured MTA on the
          local machine (i.e. /usr/sbin/sendmail).
        
        * There's a help page listing all the keyboard shortcuts.
        
        * The user interface can be translated (and is translated into Lithuanian).
          Reports are an exception (GH: #45).
        
        * More efficient file change watching (GH: #11).
        
        * Dropped features:
        
          - No more tray icons.
          - Dropped --tray, --toggle, --quit, --sample-config command
            line options.
          - The "Reload" menu option and hot key are gone -- reloading is automatic now.
          - Report for a custom date range is gone.
          - "Complete report in spreadsheet" is gone.
          - "Work/slacking stats in spreadsheet" is gone.
          - Setting for editor is gone: the default file association for text
            files will be used.
          - Settings for mailer is gone: mail sending is internal now.
          - Setting for spreadsheet is gone.
          - Separate setting to show remaining office hours is gone (set office hours
            to 0 to hide the estimate).
